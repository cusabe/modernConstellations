# Artist Statement

I love looking at the stars in the night sky, and you can see them remarkably well on a clear Canberra night.  Sometimes I wonder how the ancient cultures decided on the constellations - this is a lion and that is a scorpion - and what shapes we would come up with in the modern era if we were making sense of the stars for the first time.

Modern Constellations answers that question, as seen from the point of view of a space probe in orbit around the Earth.  Perhaps you are an alien anthropologist or traveller from the far future come back to learn how the Earthlings lived.  Your systems have picked up Earth’s constellation data to display on your viewing window as your space pod pans around to take in the sights.  “These strange symbols must have been very important for the rituals and practices of these people who lived such a long time ago - around the 2nd millennium in their counting system.  I wonder what they mean?”
